\section*{Exercise 20}
  Given Information:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item no draws
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item no loops where the loosing player can go in, in order to prevent
        the loose and loops the winning player can go in can be ignored (why go
        in a loop in case you can win the game?).
        \item the game structure can be represented by a graph which has the
        form of a tree
      \end{enumerate}
      \item finite
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item the graph structure is finite
      \end{enumerate}
      \item perfect information
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item both player know the graph
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    Let $V$ be the set of different game position in the graph $G=(V,E)$,
    $V_0\subseteq V$ the positions where player 0 has to move, analogous $V_1$
    and $V_1 = V\setminus V_0$. Let $T_\sigma$ be all the leaves of the tree where
    $T_{\sigma_0}\subseteq T_\sigma$ are the game positions player $0$ wins and
    $T_{\sigma_1}= T_\sigma\setminus T_{\sigma_0}$ are the game positions player $1$ wins,

    \textbf{Base Case}: 

    $\forall v \in T_{\sigma}$ a player has a winning strategy. So for
    every leave there exists a winning strategy for a player.
    
    \textbf{Induction Step}:

    $ \circ,\star \in \{\Box , \bigcirc\}$, where $\Box$ means that player 0 has a winning
    strategy and $\bigcirc$ means that player 1 has a winning strategy. If $
    \circ = \Box$, player 0 has a winning strategy in $\star$, if $\circ =
    \bigcirc$ the choosing player has a winning strategy in $\star$.

    By induction every node $v\in V$ has a winning strategy for one player.
